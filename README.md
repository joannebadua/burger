# Full-stack burgers app 
This interactive application logs the burger(s) users input. Be as deliciously creative with your burger! Click devour to have it stored in the devoured pile.

Full-stack means that the appilication's front-end (the visible parts of a website) fully functions with the back end (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure).

## How the burger app is made
Node.js and MySQL query and route data from the user's input. Handlebars.js generates the HTML withand a homemade Object-relational Mapping (ORM).  MVC design pattern and RESTful framework are used.
